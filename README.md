# Word Ladder

This program implements a solution to the word ladder puzzle game in Python. The objective is to change one word into another by changing one letter at a time. The goal is to find the shortest sequence of valid words that leads from the start word to the end word. (i.e. hate --> love = hate, have, hove, love)
